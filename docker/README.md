# Docker for Beginner

### Docker for Beginners: Architecture and Use Cases

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package applications and all their dependencie s into a standardized unit that runs consistently across different computing environments. Docker simplifies the process of managing applications in a microservices architecture, improving scalability, portability, and isolation.

#### Docker Architecture

The core components of Docker architecture include:

1. **Docker Engine**: The Docker engine is the heart of Docker. It has two main components:
   - **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**: The Docker Daemon is a server-side component responsible for managing Docker containers and images. It handles building, running, and managing containers, as well as managing the Docker images.
   - **Docker CLI (`docker`)**: The Docker CLI is the command-line interface that allows users to interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker Daemon and displays the results. Users can create, manage, and delete containers using Docker CLI commands.

2. **Docker Images**: 
   - A Docker image is a snapshot of a container. It contains the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and other files required to run an application. Docker images are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.
   - Images are stored in registries like Docker Hub or private registries.

3. **Docker Containers**:
   - A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It contains the application and all its dependencies. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
   - Containers are lightweight because they share the host system’s OS kernel rather than running their own operating system like virtual machines do.

4. **Docker Registries**:
   - Docker images are stored in registries. The most common registry is Docker Hub, but you can also use private registries.
   - When you pull an image (e.g., `docker pull ubuntu`), Docker downloads the image from the registry.

5. **Docker Compose (Optional)**:
   - Docker Compose is a tool used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure multiple containers using a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define services, networks, and volumes.

#### How Docker Works:
1. **Build**: Docker allows you to build custom images using a Dockerfile, which is a scr 
   
2. **Ship**: Docker images can be shared across systems through Docker registries (like Docker Hub), allowing developers to ship their applications with ease.

3. **Run**: Once the image is downloaded or created, it is used to launch containers, which run the application. The application will run the same way regardless of the underlying environment (e.g., developer’s local machine, testing environment, or production server).

#### Key Concepts in Docker

- **Dockerfile**: A text file with a series of instructions to create a Docker image. Example instructions include `FROM`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`,`RUN`, `EXPOSE` and `CMD`.
- **Volumes**: Used to persist data and share it between containers.
- **Networks**: Docker allows containers to communicate with each other through networks. You can create custom networks to isolate containers or expose them to the external world.

#### Use Cases for Docker

1. **Simplified Development and Testing**:
   - Developers can create containers with the exact dependencies required for the application, ensuring that the development environment matches the production environment. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem.

2. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Docker is ideal for deploying applications in a microservices architecture where each microservice runs in its own container. Docker containers can easily communicate with each other via networks, and they can be scaled independently.

3. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**:
   - Docker is widely used in CI/CD pipelines because it ensures consistency across different stages of development, testing, and production. Docker containers can be built, tested, and deployed automatically.

4. **Portability and Isolation**:
   - Docker ensures that an application works the same regardless of the environment. Containers are isolated from the host system and other containers, which improves security and avoids dependency conflicts.
   
5. **Cloud and Multi-cloud Deployments**:
   - Docker allows applications to be easily deployed to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others. Docker containers provide a consistent environment for applications across different cloud providers.

6. **Edge Computing**:
   - Docker is often used for deploying lightweight applications at the edge, where computational resources might be limited. The ability to package an application with its dependencies into a small, portable container is ideal for edge devices.

7. **Legacy Application Migration**:
   - Docker allows companies to containerize legacy applications, making it easier to migrate them to modern infrastructure without requiring extensive refactoring.
  
8. **Server Consolidation**:
   - By running multiple containers on a single host, Docker allows for better resource utilization and server consolidation compared to running multiple virtual machines.

#### Example Docker Workflow

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: This defines how your Docker image will be built.
   ```dockerfile
   # Use official Node.js image from Docker Hub
   FROM node:14

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the package.json and install dependencies
   COPY package.json ./
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose the application port
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Start the application
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**: This command creates an image from the Dockerfile.
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   docker build -t 200901/web-app:v1.0.0 .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**: This command runs the Docker container from the image.
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
   ```

4. **Push the Image to Docker Hub**: This command pushes the image to Docker Hub so others can use it.
   ```bash
   docker tag my-node-app username/my-node-app
   docker push username/my-node-app
   ```

To push the Docker images to your Docker registry (`200901/abp-dev`), you need to follow these steps:

### Steps:

1. **Tag the Images:**
   You need to tag each of your images with the target repository `200901/abp-dev`. Based on your current tagging, you will need to retag the images to ensure they point to `200901/abp-dev`.

   Here's how to do it for each image:

   - For `app001_brizit-api-service`:
     ```bash
     docker tag app001_brizit-api-service 200901/abp-dev:app001_brizit-api-service-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `mysql:8`:
     ```bash
     docker tag mysql:8 200901/abp-dev:mysql-db-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `nginx:alpine`:
     ```bash
     docker tag nginx:alpine 200901/abp-dev:nginx-web-server-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin`:
     ```bash
     docker tag phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin 200901/abp-dev:phpmyadmin-db-viewer-v1.0.0
     ```

   ### Explanation:
   - `docker tag <source-image> <target-repository>:<tag>`: This command tags an image so that it can be pushed to a repository.
   - The target format is `200901/abp-dev:<image-name>:<tag>`, where:
     - `200901/abp-dev`: Your repository name.
     - `<image-name>`: The name of your image.
     - `<tag>`: The version or tag of the image.

2. **Login to Docker Registry:**
   Before pushing images, make sure you're logged in to your Docker registry. You can log in using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter your Docker Hub credentials (or credentials for a custom registry).

3. **Push the Images to the Registry:**
   Now that the images are tagged correctly, you can push each of them to your `200901/abp-dev` registry.

   - For `app001_brizit-api-service`:
     ```bash
     docker push 200901/abp-dev:app001_brizit-api-service-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `mysql:8`:
     ```bash
     docker push 200901/abp-dev:mysql-db-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `nginx:alpine`:
     ```bash
     docker push 200901/abp-dev:nginx-web-server-v1.0.0
     ```

   - For `phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin`:
     ```bash
     docker push 200901/abp-dev:phpmyadmin-db-viewer-v1.0.0
     ```

### Example Workflow:

Here's a summary of the entire process:

```bash
# Tag each image for the target registry
{
#!/usr/bin bash
docker tag app001_brizit-api-service 200901/abp-dev:app001_brizit-api-service-v1.0.0
docker tag mysql:8 200901/abp-dev:mysql-db-v1.0.0
docker tag nginx:alpine 200901/abp-dev:nginx-web-server-v1.0.0
docker tag phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin 200901/abp-dev:phpmyadmin-db-viewer-v1.0.0
}

# Login to the Docker registry
docker login

# Push the images to the registry
{ 
 #!/usr/bin bash
docker push 200901/abp-dev:app001_brizit-api-service-v1.0.0
docker push 200901/abp-dev:mysql-db-v1.0.0
docker push 200901/abp-dev:nginx-web-server-v1.0.0
docker push 200901/abp-dev:phpmyadmin-db-viewer-v1.0.0
}
```

### Notes:
- **Docker Tagging**: Tagging the images ensures that they are linked to the right repository and version. You can use any name and tag format for your images, but the above method ensures the images are named consistently with your registry format.
- **Docker Login**: If you are using a custom registry, you may need to specify the registry URL when logging in, e.g., `docker login myregistry.example.com`.

After following these steps, your images will be uploaded to the `200901/abp-dev` repository and will be available for deployment or use.



# Intermediate


To move to **intermediate Docker** concepts, you’ll need to understand how to efficiently use Docker for more complex applications. This includes container orchestration, Docker networking, volume management, multi-stage builds, and more. Below, I’ll cover several intermediate Docker concepts to help you understand how to use Docker more effectively.

### 1. **Multi-Stage Builds**

Multi-stage builds help to reduce the size of your Docker images by allowing you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each stage can perform a different task, and only the necessary files are included in the final image.

#### Example:

```dockerfile
# First stage: Build the application
FROM node:16 AS build-stage

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

# Second stage: Prepare the production image
FROM nginx:alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-stage /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

In this example:
- The first stage builds the application using Node.js.
- The second stage uses the `nginx:alpine` image and copies only the build output from the first stage.
- This reduces the size of the final image because the build tools (Node.js, npm, etc.) are not included.

### 2. **Docker Compose**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define a multi-container setup in a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file allows you to define services, networks, and volumes, and then bring up everything with a single command.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml` for a Web App (Node + MongoDB):

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mongo:latest
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

In this example:
- The `web` service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory and runs a Node.js application.
- The `db` service uses the official `mongo` image for a MongoDB database.
- `depends_on` ensures that MongoDB starts before the web app.
- The `volumes` section is used to persist data between container restarts.

To run the entire stack:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. **Docker Networking**

Docker provides several network modes to connect containers. Understanding how Docker networking works is crucial for multi-container applications.

#### Key Network Modes:
- **bridge** (default): Containers can communicate with each other and the host system, but not with external systems by default.
- **host**: Containers share the host's network stack, making it more efficient but less isolated.
- **none**: Containers have no networking, useful for isolated tasks.
- **overlay**: For multi-host networking, typically used with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

#### Example:
Creating a custom network:

```bash
docker network create my-network
```

Running two containers on this network:

```bash
docker run -d --name container1 --network my-network nginx
docker run -d --name container2 --network my-network alpine ping container1
```

Now, `container2` can ping `container1` using the container's name as the hostname because they are on the same custom network.

### 4. **Docker Volumes**

Volumes are used to persist data outside of the container filesystem. This is essential for things like database data, log files, or application data that should survive container restarts or removals.

#### Creating a volume:

```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

#### Using a volume in a container:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container -v my-volume:/app/data my-image
```

This will mount the `my-volume` volume to the `/app/data` directory inside the container.

#### Inspecting volumes:

```bash
docker volume inspect my-volume
```

This allows you to check where the volume data is stored on the host machine.

### 5. **Docker Logs & Debugging**

Docker provides various commands to view logs and debug issues in containers.

#### View logs of a running container:

```bash
docker logs <container_name_or_id>
```

This is useful for debugging running containers, especially web services and databases.

#### Follow logs in real time:

```bash
docker logs -f <container_name_or_id>
```

#### Docker exec (for debugging):

You can run commands inside a running container for troubleshooting:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash
```

This opens an interactive shell inside the container, where you can check files, run commands, etc.

### 6. **Docker Tags & Images Management**

Understanding how to manage Docker images and tags is critical for maintaining and versioning your containers. Docker allows you to tag images to differentiate versions.

#### Build and tag an image:

```bash
docker build -t my-app:v1 .
```

#### List Docker images:

```bash
docker images
```

#### Remove a Docker image:

```bash
docker rmi my-app:v1
```

#### Push an image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push my-app:v1
```

If you're using a private registry or Docker Hub, ensure you're logged in before pushing:

```bash
docker login
```

### 7. **Container Lifecycle Management**

You need to understand how to start, stop, and manage Docker containers in different states.

#### Start a container from an image:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-container my-image
```

#### Stop a running container:

```bash
docker stop my-container
```

#### Remove a stopped container:

```bash
docker rm my-container
```

#### Remove an image:

```bash
docker rmi my-image
```

### 8. **Docker Security**

Securing your Docker containers is vital, especially in production environments.

- **Limit container privileges**: Use the `USER` directive to avoid running containers as the root user.
- **Use Docker Secrets** for sensitive data (like passwords, API keys). This is available in Docker Swarm or with Docker Compose.
- **Docker Content Trust**: Enable it to sign images and ensure only trusted images are used.

#### Docker Content Trust:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker pull my-secure-image
```

This ensures only signed and trusted images are pulled.

### 9. **Docker Compose Override**

You can override configuration settings or set additional parameters using a `docker-compose.override.yml` file. This file is automatically used alongside the main `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Example `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
```

This file overrides the web service's port and sets an environment variable, allowing you to have different configurations for development and production environments.

### 10. **CI/CD with Docker**

Docker is often used in CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions can automate Docker container management.

A typical CI/CD flow might involve:
- Building a Docker image for every commit.
- Running tests inside containers.
- Deploying containers to production or staging environments.

#### Example GitHub Actions for Docker:

```yaml
name: Docker Build & Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: myusername/myapp:latest
```

# Advance

You're welcome! Now let's dive into **advanced Docker** concepts. At this level, you'll be working with more complex scenarios, such as orchestrating multi-container environments, advanced networking, performance optimization, security best practices, and integrating Docker into large-scale systems. Here's a breakdown of advanced Docker topics to help you master the tool.

---

### 1. **Docker Swarm & Orchestration**

Docker Swarm is Docker's built-in container orchestration tool. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker engines and run containers across multiple machines in a highly available and scalable way.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Swarm Mode**: Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool.
- **Services**: Defines the tasks you want to run in the swarm.
- **Replicas**: Specifies how many instances of a service to run.
- **Stacks**: A group of services (defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file) that you deploy together.

#### Example: Initialize a Docker Swarm

```bash
docker swarm init
```

This command initializes the machine as a manager node.

#### Example: Deploy a Service in Swarm Mode

```bash
docker service create --name web --replicas 3 -p 80:80 nginx
```

This command will create an `nginx` service with 3 replicas, meaning 3 containers will be running across the swarm.

#### Example: Deploy a Stack (using Compose)

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack
```

This will deploy a set of services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file to your swarm cluster.

---

### 2. **Kubernetes (K8s) vs Docker Swarm**

While Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration tool, Kubernetes (K8s) is the more widely used and feature-rich platform for container orchestration. 

#### Key Differences:
- **Kubernetes**: 
  - Highly scalable and fault-tolerant.
  - Supports complex application deployments, monitoring, and management.
  - More sophisticated networking and storage management.
  - Multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments.
  
- **Docker Swarm**: 
  - Simpler to set up.
  - More tightly integrated with Docker.
  - Good for smaller to medium-sized applications or when you need simplicity.

#### Kubernetes with Docker:

Though Kubernetes does not use Docker as its default container runtime anymore (since Kubernetes 1.20+, it uses containerd), Docker is still often used to build images for deployment to Kubernetes clusters.

---

### 3. **Advanced Docker Networking**

Networking is a critical concept when deploying containers at scale. Advanced networking in Docker allows containers to communicate with each other securely across different environments, handle service discovery, and configure complex network topologies.

#### Network Drivers:
- **bridge**: Default network driver; suitable for single-host communication.
- **host**: Containers share the host's network stack.
- **overlay**: Used in Docker Swarm or multi-host networking to allow containers on different hosts to communicate.
- **macvlan**: Assigns a unique MAC address to each container, making it appear as if they are physically separate devices.

#### Example: Create a Custom Overlay Network

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my-overlay-network
```

This creates an overlay network that can be used in Docker Swarm mode.

#### Example: Network Aliases in Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      my-network:
        aliases:
          - webapp

  db:
    image: mysql
    networks:
      my-network:
        aliases:
          - database

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: overlay
```

This allows `webapp` and `database` to communicate with each other using DNS names.

---

### 4. **Docker Security Best Practices**

Security is paramount in containerized environments. Docker has various features to help you secure your containers and images.

#### Key Practices:
- **Run Containers as Non-root**: Always run containers with a non-root user unless absolutely necessary. This reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks.
  
  Example:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN useradd -m webuser
  USER webuser
  ```

- **Use Docker Content Trust**: Docker Content Trust (DCT) ensures that you only pull signed images. This helps in preventing the use of tampered images.

  To enable Docker Content Trust:
  ```bash
  export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
  ```

- **Use Official Base Images**: Use official images from Docker Hub or well-maintained community images. Official images are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities.

- **Use Docker Secrets**: For sensitive data like passwords, use Docker Secrets (with Swarm mode). This securely stores and manages credentials.

  Example:
  ```bash
  echo "mysecretpassword" | docker secret create my_db_password -
  ```

- **Scanning for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like **Trivy** or **Clair** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

  Example with **Trivy**:
  ```bash
  trivy image my-image:latest
  ```

---

### 5. **Docker Performance Optimization**

Docker containers are lightweight, but there are still ways to optimize their performance.

#### Optimizing Dockerfiles:
- **Leverage Docker Layer Caching**: Arrange instructions in the Dockerfile to maximize caching. Put commands that don’t change often (like `RUN apt-get install`) early, and more frequently changing commands (like `COPY . .`) later.
  
  Example:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
  RUN npm install
  COPY . . 
  ```

- **Reduce Image Size**: Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size by including only the necessary artifacts in the final image.

#### Memory & CPU Limits:

When running containers, you can restrict the resources (CPU, memory) allocated to each container.

```bash
docker run -d --memory="500m" --cpus="1" my-image
```

This limits the container to use at most 500 MB of memory and 1 CPU core.

#### Swarm Resource Management:
Docker Swarm can manage resource limits at the service level.

```bash
docker service create --name my-service --limit-cpu 0.5 --limit-memory 512m my-image
```

---

### 6. **Docker with CI/CD Integration**

Docker is integral to continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Docker images are often built automatically and deployed to various environments (staging, production).

#### CI/CD Tools:
- **Jenkins**: Jenkins can build, test, and deploy Docker containers.
- **GitLab CI**: GitLab CI allows you to build and push Docker images as part of your pipeline.
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions can automate building Docker images and pushing them to Docker Hub or any other registry.

Example of a simple GitHub Actions workflow to build and push Docker images:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t myusername/myapp:latest .
      
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker push myusername/myapp:latest
```

---

### 7. **Docker Registry Management**

For large teams and projects, managing your own Docker registry can be beneficial. You can use **Docker Registry** (or **Harbor** for enterprise-grade registry management).

#### Running your own Docker Registry:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
```

This starts a local Docker registry on port 5000. To push an image to this registry:

1. Tag the image:
   ```bash
   docker tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image
   ```

2. Push to your registry:
   ```bash
   docker push localhost:5000/my-image
   ```

---

### 8. **Advanced Docker Compose**

With Docker Compose, you can manage more complex multi-container setups and define detailed configurations for your services.

#### Example of defining multiple environments in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: my-app
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=production
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  
  dev-db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
      - POSTGRES_USER=devuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword
  
  prod-db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
      - POSTGRES_USER=produser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=prodpassword
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
```

This allows you to specify different configurations for production and development databases, among other things.

---

### 9. **Advanced Docker Logging**

Managing logs for Docker containers at scale is important in production. You can configure logging drivers for Docker to capture logs more effectively.

#### Key Logging Drivers:
- **json-file**: Default driver, stores logs in JSON format.
- **syslog**: Sends logs to a syslog server.
- **fluentd**: Integrates with Fluentd for log aggregation.

Example: Run a container with a specific logging driver:

```bash
docker run --log-driver=syslog my-container


```

---

### 10. **Docker + Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**

For large-scale deployments, monitoring your Docker containers is crucial. Prometheus and Grafana are commonly used for container monitoring.

#### Example: Using Prometheus with Docker

1. Run the **Prometheus container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name prometheus prom/prometheus
   ```

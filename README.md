# Developer and Operator in the DevOps Process (Development and Operations)

## Introduction
- I have read in many articles about DevOps that "DevOps is about people and communication." While this statement emphasizes an important aspect, it overlooks a critical component: **tools**. Tools play a fundamental role in the DevOps process, and in many cases, they take priority over people and communication.
  
- In reality, the nature of the organization you work for depends largely on the tools available in its environment and the tools you use. Therefore, DevOps should be seen as a combination of **tools**, **people**, and **communication**, with **tools** taking precedence in this hierarchy.

## Tools Categories
